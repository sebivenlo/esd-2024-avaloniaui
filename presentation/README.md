# Competitors to Avalonia

FLutter

Maui

Electron

# Language and Ecosystem
Avalonia UI uses C# and .NET, which can be advantageous if you're already familiar with this ecosystem1. This contrasts with Flutter (which uses Dart) and Electron (which uses JavaScript/TypeScript).

# UI Rendering Approach
Avalonia UI employs a custom drawing engine powered by Skia, similar to Flutter1. This approach offers:
Consistency: Your app will have the same look and feel across all platforms1.
Flexibility: Greater control over UI design and custom elements.
Simplified Maintenance: UI code remains the same across platforms.

# Performance
Avalonia UI apps offer native performance and consume significantly fewer resources compared to Electron apps, which use web technologies.
Platform Support
Avalonia UI supports a wide range of platforms:

Desktop: Windows (7 and up), macOS, Linux

Mobile: iOS and Android

Web: WebAssembly support

Emerging Platforms: visionOS and Tizen OS (upcoming)
This broad support exceeds that of MAUI, which lacks Linux and web support.

# Licensing

Avalonia UI has a permissive MIT license, allowing free use for all projects.
